## Research Paper Overview
### Title: [An Efficient Machine Learning Approach for Bitcoin Price Prediction](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00521-020-05129-6)
The research paper proposes a methodology for Bitcoin price prediction using ANN. The key steps involved are:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and normalizing Bitcoin price datasets.
2. **Feature Selection**: Choosing relevant features affecting Bitcoin prices.
3. **Model Implementation**: Training an ANN model with selected features.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE).

## Project Enhancements
### Updates in `Training_ANN_cls_updated.ipynb`
The following enhancements were made to the original methodology:
1. **Additional Dataset Integration**: Introduced new datasets from [GitHub Dataset Link](https://github.com/heliphix/btc_data/tree/paper_datasets) to test the model's robustness in different contexts.
2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experimented with different values for learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs to optimize the ANN performance.
3. **Enhanced Architecture**: Added dropout layers to reduce overfitting and adjusted the number of neurons in hidden layers for better performance.
4. **Evaluation Metrics**: Incorporated additional metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-Squared for comprehensive performance evaluation.
5. **Visualization**: Added detailed visualizations of training loss, accuracy, and prediction trends for better interpretability.

### How the Updates Satisfy Assignment Instructions
- **Replication**: The original methodology was implemented as described in the research paper, ensuring reproducibility of results.
- **Significant Contribution**: The updates introduce methodological improvements, exploring the impact of advanced techniques on the modelâ€™s accuracy and generalizability.
- **Testing on New Datasets**: The ANN model was evaluated on datasets different from the original study, fulfilling the requirement to test effectiveness in new contexts.
